# ClassWarmup
A simple project to practise operations about things like class, `__init__()`, method, attribute and so on.

Meanwhile, this is the first remote repo I upload to GitHub with following GitBash code.

When `git init`, `-b main` means branch name is `main`.  
When `git add`, `.` means add all files and directories under current directory.  
When `git commit`, `-m <some string>` means the string would be taken as a message for this commit.  

    cd G:/MyPython/warm_ups/class_warmup
    git init -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "First commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/zhu-yuefeng/ClassWarmup.git
